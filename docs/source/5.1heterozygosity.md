# 5.1 Dealing with heterozygous genomes
In some cases fungal genomes are heterozygous or polyploid which can influence the genome annotation results, i.e., more genes are predicted that actually are copies of each other. To resolve this there are few tools out there but the one that works best for me so far is `purge_dups`.

## Using `purge_dups`to create a haploid genome assembly
